# drools-demo

This is the Drools7 demo I made when I was learning Drools for version 7.45.0 Final. Drools is a tool to seperate business rule and codes. I have many examples for rule's syntax, and also I have a more complex example for a promotion scenario.

* Rule 1, 10% discount to all customers.
* Rule 2, Buy 3 get 1 for free.
* Rule 3, With a minimux of $100, $10 off.

Hope you enjoy this demo :)
Also, if I made something wrong in this demo, please let me know.
Thanks a lot :)
